##Â Dependency information

This relies on:

* A forked version of the [IPFS HTTP Client](https://github.com/solui/js-ipfs-http-client/tree/fix_cids_import)
* The [Pinata SDK](https://github.com/PinataCloud/Pinata-SDK), which internally relies on the `fs` node module. If you're building a browser-side library/app remember to polyfill this.
